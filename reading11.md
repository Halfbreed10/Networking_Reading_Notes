### Windows Server
Its important to understand the difference between a sevrer and a desktop. While troubleshooting an issue knowing the difference will make the process easier. Knowing how to access the server is also important. 

What is a server, and how is it different from a regular computer? How would you describe this difference to a friend who doesnâ€™t know much about computers? A server is a computing system that processes services for usersa across a network. A regular computer uses Windows and gives you a desktop you can actually sit in front of and use for your everyday issues. For example, going to a restuarant you see everything in the front and you can eat the food that comes from the kitchen. However, the kitchen is acutually running the operation becuase without them you would not get your food the specific way you ordered it.  

How does the way Windows Server receives updates differ from Windows Home and Pro? Windows Server editions offer more flexibility, control, and testing opportunities for updates, tailored to meet the stringent requirements of critical server environments. Meanwhile, Windows Home and Pro editions prioritize regular, more automated updates aimed at consumer and small business users, with less control over update scheduling and installation.

Does Windows Server have different hardware requirements than Windows Home or Pro? Yes, Windows server supports more powerful hardware such as allows 24 TB of RAM and instead of one CPU the servecan support up to 62.
