### Web Server Deployment

What are some common use cases for NGINX? Some common use cases for NGINX are web serving, reverse proxying, caching, load balancing, media streaming, etc.

How does NGINX handle tasks that could slow down the web server? Acting as an intermediary, NGINX efficiently handles tasks that might slow down your web server, such as negotiating SSL/TLS or compressing and caching content to improve performance.

Describe, as if to a non-technical friend how to actually pronounce “NGINX”, and why an org might chooose to use it. I would describe pronouncing NGINX by breaking it down, starting with breaking it into syllables and sound the word out, IN-GIN-NEX. Organizations might choose to use NGINX because of its high performance, web server capabilities, reverse proxy and HTTP/HTTPS handling capabilities, application delivery, web security, and its flexibility.
