## Networking and Systems Administration

### CIDR Block Notation
Understanding what IP address are and how they are broken up makes easieer for trouble shooting issues or setting up network firewalls for certain sites. 

What is CIDR notation? a CIDR block? CIDR notation is a way of representing a CIDR block, and a CIDR block is a range of IP addresses.

How many octets are found in an IPv4 address? There are 4 octets/8-bit decimal numbers.

Setting binary aside and using the decimal system, what is the range of numbers found in an octet? An 8-bit number when represented in the decimal system as opposed to binary has a range of 0–255.

What does the final digit after the “/” represent in an IPv4 address? The final digit after the “/” represents how many bits make up the mask.

How many IP addresses are in the CIDR block 10.0.0.0/24? This block contains 256 IP addresses.

### What Is Network Segmentation and Why It Matters?

In your own words, describe network segmentation. Network segmentation is when the computers network is seperated by firewalls, switches, and routers. For example, having a firewall blocking you from accessing a certain website.

Network segmentation isn’t important as long as the network is using a well configured firewall. Do you agree? Why or why not? I do not agree because firewalls alone cannot protect your digital assets and can become obsolete within a generation. The more protection you have over your information the better.

What is a screened subnet? A screened subnet also known as a demilitarized zone (DMZ), is a network architecture setup used in computer security to create a secure intermediary zone.

Cameras, ID card scanners, locked doors and biometrics are just a few examples of what type of security? These items are an example of Traditional Physical Security.
