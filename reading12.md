### What is a Windows Domain and How Does It Affect My PC?

Explain the role of a Domain Controller? Domain controllers are one or more servers that have control over a domain and the computer in it, such as user names and passwords.

What is the benefit of being able to login with the same username and password on any computer joined to the domain? What are the security risks? The benefits are convenience, user experience, and centralized management. The security risks are credential theft and single point of failure, lateral movement for attackers, and Pass-the-Hash and Pass-the-Ticket attacks, inscreased attack surface, and Lack of Granular Control. 

Describe how group policies are used in domains? Group policies are used for creation, settings, targeted applkication, and inhertance.

In what other ways can you think of that domains could be used beyond what was presented in the reading? You could used them in a sports setting, by havign everyone on the team use the same domain. All tape could be connected and eveeryone will have access to the same information.
